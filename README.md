# 42 Rushes

Welcome to my 42 Rushes repository. This repository contains Python implementations of the three rush projects of 42 Piscine. Each one has its own detailed README file. Below is an overview of each project along with links to their respective README files.

## Projects

### rush00 (ASCII rectangles): 
This project generates rectangular patterns using ASCII characters. Each of the five pattern variants (00 through 04) has its own unique set of characters and rules for the corners and edges of the rectangle. In this code, all five are generated, instead of the project requirement of generating one that is assigned to you.
